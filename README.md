# Pushing a Docker Image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

Pushing a Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) involves several steps. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

## Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI Installed**: Ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.
- **Docker Installed**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your local machine.
- **ECR Repository**: Have an existing ECR repository, or create one.



# Steps to Push a Docker Image to Amazon ECR

## 1. Authenticate Docker to ECR
Run the following command to authenticate Docker with your ECR repository:


aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

Replace:

region: Your AWS region  (e.g., us-east-1).  
aws_account_id: Your AWS account ID.  

## 2. Build Your Docker Image
Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and build the image:


docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .




## 3. Tag the Image
Tag the Docker image for your ECR repository:


docker tag <image_name>:<tag> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:<tag>

## 4. Push the Image to ECR
Push the image to the ECR repository:



docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:<tag>


## 5. Verify the Image in ECR
Log in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the ECR service, and confirm the image is in your repository.
